# AI

## Artificial Intelligence Tripleism

### Symbolicism

#### Knowledge Map

#### NLP

### Evolutionism / Cyberneticsism

#### Reinforcement Learning

#### Automation Control

### Connectionism

#### Neural Networks

#### 2 Low tide or 3 high tide

* Perceptron, 1950s, High
* Linear perceptron function is limited, 1968, Low
* Back-propagation Algorithm, 1986, High
* SVM Algorithm, 1995, Low
* Multilayer neural network structure with AutoEncoder, 2006, High

## Machine Learning = Algorithm + Neural Networks

  Let the machine behave like the intelligent behavior that people show.

### ID3 Decision tree algorithm, 1986
### Regression & Clustering -> VC Dimension
### SVM & RandomForest

### Three Modes of Machine Learning

#### Supervised Learning

#### Unsupervised Learning

#### Reinforcement Learning

### Machine Learning Directions

#### Machine Learning Scientist

  Research Machine Learning Algorithm

#### Machine Learning Engineering

  Apply Machine Learning Algorithm to current business.

#### Machine Learning Platform

  Build and Maintain Distributed Machine Learning Platform


### Deep Learning = AutoEncoder + Multilayer neural network structure

# Data Mining vs Machine Learning

  ![machine-learning-vs-data-mining](machine-learning-vs-data-mining.png)

## Recommended System and Advertisement System

### Machine Learning -> CTR Prediction algorithm

### Data Mining -> Mining new characteristics in data

## Searching Engine

  Machine Learning is relatively less important.

### Crawler Sub-system

### Information Index Sub-system

### Association Rules

## NLP, Computer Visual and Sound Recognization

# Big Data vs Machine Learning

## 4V

### Volume

### Velocity

### Variety

### Value

## 3 Factors

  Hadoop is created based on it, and Spark is based on it.

### Google FS
### MapReduce
### Bigtable

# Data Analysis

  Focus in human's subjective initiative to analysis the data.

# A funny history roadmap of Hadoop
