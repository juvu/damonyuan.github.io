## Criteria for Earning and Owing

As a result, accrual accounting has very clear criteria for specifying the moment the seller earns as well as the moment that the customer owes (incurs an expense).

- Earning coincides with service or goods delivery. The seller earns revenues when and only when the seller delivers purchased goods or services.
- Owing coincides with receipt—or consumption—of goods or services. The tenant renting floor space does not incur (owe) the rental expense until the tenant occupies the space, even though the landlord may have required prepayment.
