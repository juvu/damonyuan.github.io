Significance","keywords":"","body":"Statistical Significance\nStatistical significance is based on a few simple concepts: hypothesis testing, normal distribution and p-value.\nThe first issue we will discuss is hypothesis testing, a technique that uses data to assess theory. A \"hypothesis\" is a researcher's initial conjecture about the pre-study situation. This initial theory is referred to as the alternative hypothesis, while the opposite theory is referred to as the null hypothesis.\nThe testing component of hypothesis testing allows us to determine which hypothesis, the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis, is better supported by the evidence. In many hypothesis tests, a method called the z-test is used.\n\n\nThe p-value is the probability of observing an outcome that is at least as extreme as the measured outcome when the null hypothesis is true. The lower the p-value, the more meaningful the result is, as it is less likely to be caused by noise.\nWhether the results are statistically significant depends on the significance p-value (called alpha) established before starting the experiment. If the observed p-value is less than alpha, the result is statistically significant. The alpha needs to be chosen before the study because if after the study, one can choose a number to prove that the results are significant, regardless of what the data show!\nThe choice of α depends on the situation and the field of study, but the most commonly used value is 0.05, which corresponds to a 5% probability that the result is a random occurrence. In usual statistics, the commonly used value is between 0.1 and 0.001. As an extreme example, the physicist who discovered the Higgs boson particle used an alpha value of 0.0000003, or a probability of only 1 in 3.5 million that the particle was discovered due to noise.\n"},"blogs/tech/2021/2021-08-10-microservice-caveat.html":{"url":"blogs/tech/2021/2021-08-10-microservice-caveat.html","title":"Microservice Caveat","keywords":"","body":"Microservice Caveat\nThere are three common problems in microservice architecture.\nIncomplete Infrastructure / 基础设施不完备\nSome of the infrastructure in microservice is indispensable.\nIngress Gateway\n!

This pattern helps to hide the implementation details from the method callers, and it's just a simple illustration of interface-oriented programming.\nNote StrategyContext doesn't implement Strategy interface. \nProxy Pattern\nclass StrategyProxy implements Strategy {\n    private Strategy strategy;\n    public StrategyProxy() {\n        this.strategy = new ConcreteStrategy();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean run(String[] args) {\n        return this.strategy.run(args);\n    }\n}\nThis pattern is quite similar to the Strategy Pattern except that here the strategy details are hidden from the proxy dependents, however in Strategy Pattern the concrete strategy is injected through the constructor.\nNote both StrategyProxy and ConcreteStrategy have implement the Strategy interface.\nDecorator Pattern\nclass ConcreteComponent implements Component {\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        System.out.println(\"running\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass Decorator implements Component {\n    private Component component = null;\n    public void setComponent(Component component) {\n        this.component = component;\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        System.out.println(\"before running\");\n        this.component.run();\n        System.out.println(\"after running\");\n    }\n}\nThis pattern helps to add more functionalities without changing the original target instance.\nAdaptor Pattern\nThe implementation of Adaptor Pattern is the same as that of Proxy Pattern while with different goal.\npublic interface Worker {\n    void run();\n}\nClass BeggerAdaptor implements Worker {\n    private Begger begger;\n    public BeggerAdaptor() {\n        this.begger = new Begger();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        this.begger.beg();\n    }\n}\nNote only BeggerAdaptor has implemented the Worker interface.\nFactory Patterns\nSingleton Pattern\nThere are multiple implementation methods for Singleton Pattern in Java as listed here - Java Singleton Design Pattern Best Practices with Examples. My favorite one is Bill Pugh Singleton Implementation, because it's concise and thread-safe.\npublic class BillPughSingleton {\n    private BillPughSingleton(){}\n    private static class SingletonHelper{\n        private static final BillPughSingleton INSTANCE = new BillPughSingleton();\n    }\n    public static BillPughSingleton getInstance(){\n        return SingletonHelper.INSTANCE;\n    }\n}\nSimple Factory Pattern\npublic class OperationFactory {\n    public static Operation createOperation(String operation) {\n        switch (operation) {\n            case \"+\":\n                return new OperationAdd();\n            case \"-\":\n                return new OperationMinus();    \n            default:\n                return null;  \n        }\n    }\n}\nOperationAdd and OperationMinus classes implement Operation interface.\nNote that from my perspective of view Factory Pattern and Abstract Factory Pattern don't provide much value to simplify the program or make the logic clearer, so that I would prefer not to introduce them here.\nFlyweight Pattern\nThis pattern is to reduce the cost of resource on recreating instances, one common example is Java String.\npublic class FlyWeight {\n    private String name;\n    public FlyWeight(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n}\nclass FlyWeightFactory {\n    private HashMap flyweights = new HashMap<>();\n\n    public FlyWeight getFlyWeight(String name) {\n        if (!flyweights.keySet().contains(name)) {\n            flyweights.add(new FlyWeight(name));\n        }\n        return flyweight.get(name);\n    }\n}\nIn Java the strings with the same value are actually refering to the same underlying object. Although the resource used by creating a string is not substantial, because the number of operations is large, it still impact tremendously on the program overall.\nNote that in Simple Factory Pattern a new object is always returned, however in FlyWeight Pattern, only when there is no such instance will a new object be created and returned.\nBuilder Pattern\nClass ContextBuilder {\n    String color;\n    Integer size;\n    String metadata;\n    public ContextBuilder() {\n        this.color = \"red\";\n        this.size = 2;\n        this.metadata = null;\n    }\n\n    public setColor(String color) {\n        this.color = color;\n        return this;\n    }\n\n    public setSize(Integer size) {\n        this.size = size;\n        return this;\n    }\n\n    public setMetadata(String metadata) {\n        this.metadata = metadata;\n        return this;\n    }\n\n    public Context build() {\n        return new Context(this.color, this.size, this.metadata);\n    }\n}\n\npublic static void main(string[] args) {\n    ContextBuilder contextBuilder = new ContextBuilder();\n    Context context = contextBuilder\n      .setColor(\"blue\")\n      .setSize(1)\n      .setMetadata(\"builder pattern\")\n      .build();\n}\nHere we set the options for the builder and finally it will create the instance based on the requirement. \nPrototype Pattern\nIt's just to implement the Cloneable interface in java. Note that if you want to create a immutable class, you should follow How to create Immutable class in Java? and use deep copy instead of shallow copy.\nChanging Context\nChain of Responsibility Pattern\npublic interface Handler {\n    void setSuccessor(Handler hanlder);\n    void handle(int i);\n}\n\nclass AtaskHandler implements Handler {\n    private Handler successor = null;\n    @Override\n    public void setSuccessor(Handler handler) {\n        this.successor = handler;\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void handle(int i) {\n        if (this.successor) {\n            this.successor.handle(i + 1);\n        }\n    }\n}\nAnd there is another more common pattern which is widely used in servlet, \npublic interface Handler {\n    void handle(int i);\n}\nclass Processor implements Handler {\n    private List handlers = new ArrayList<>();\n    public void register(Handler handler) {\n        handlers.add(handler);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void handle(int i) {\n        for (int j = 0; j In this way the handlers don't have to the successor of itself.\nStates Pattern\npublic interface State {\n    void handle(Context context);\n}\nclass StateStarted implements State {\n    @Override\n    public void handle(Context context) {\n        // business logic here\n        context.state = new StateB();\n    }\n}\nclass StateB implements State {\n    @Override\n    public void handle(Context context) {\n        // business logic here\n        context.state = new StateFinished();\n    }\n}\nclass StateFinished implements State {\n    @Override\n    public void handle(Context context) {\n        // business logic here\n        System.out.println(\"finished\");\n    }\n}\nclass Context {\n    private State state; \n    public Context() {\n        this.state = new StateStarted();\n    }\n\n    public State getState() {\n        return this.state;\n    }\n\n    public void request() {\n        this.state().handle(this); // go to next state\n    }\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Context context = new Context();\n    context.request();\n    context.request();\n    context.request();\n\n}\nIn this way the business logic for different states is implemented in the related State, and the correlation between different business units is reduced. \nInterpreter Pattern\nclass Context {\n    private String value;\n    public Context(String v) {\n        this.value = v;\n    }\n}\npublic interface Expression {\n    void interpret(Context context);\n}\nHere the concrete Expression classes will interpret the context accordingly. This pattern can be used in syntax tree (I don't quite understand this, anyone can give an illustration?).\nVisitor Pattern\npublic interface Visitor {\n    void visit(Element e);\n}\npublic interface Element {\n    void accept(Visitor v);\n}\npublic class ConcreteVisitor implements Visitor {\n    @Override\n    public void visit(Element e) {\n        // TODO:\n    }\n}\npublic class ConcreteElement implements Element {\n    @Override\n    public void accept(Visitor v) {\n        v.visit(this);\n    }\n}\nclass Entirety implements Element {\n    private List elements = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public void add(Element e) {\n        elements.add(e);\n    }\n\n    public void remove(Element e) {\n        elements.remove(e);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void accept(Visitor v) {\n        for (Element e : this.elements) {\n            e.accept(v);\n        }\n    }\n}\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Visitor v = new ConcreteVisitor();\n    Entirety e = new Entirety();\n    e.add(new ConcreteElement());\n    e.accept(v);\n}\nThis pattern encapsulates the elements inside an Entirety object and allows the Visitor instances to visit it's internal elements.\nOthers\nTemplate Pattern\nabstract class AbstractClass {\n    public void templateMethod {\n        System.out.println(\"I am the stupid template...\");\n    }\n}\n# or use interface in Java 8 or above\npublic interface Template {\n    default void templateMethod() {\n        System.out.println(\"I am the stupid template...\");\n    }\n}\nThe target for this pattern is DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself.\nFacade Pattern\nclass Facade {\n    SubSystemOne one;\n    SubSystemTwo two;\n    Validation validation;\n\n    public Facade () {\n        this.one = new SubSystemOne();\n        this.two = new SubSystemTwo();\n        this.three = new Validation();\n    }\n\n    public void taskOne() {\n        this.one.run();\n        this.two.run();\n    }\n\n    public void taskTwo() {\n        this.validation.run();\n        this.two.run();\n    }\n}\nThis pattern is to reduce the complexity of the interface that an external dependent needs to know.\nObserver Pattern\nclass Subject {\n    private ArrayList() listeners = new ArrayList();\n    public void addListener(Listener listener) {\n        this.listeners.add(listener);\n    }\n    public void removeListener(Listener listener) {\n        this.listeners.remove(listener);\n    }\n    private void run() {\n        for (Listener l : this.listeners) {\n            l.notify(\"to run\");\n        }\n        System.out.println(\"run\");\n    }\n}\npublic interface Listener {\n    void notify(String event);\n}\nMemo Pattern\nThis pattern is quite common in frontend application when preparing the data to be submitted to the backend. \nclass Data {\n    private String username;\n    private int amount;\n    public Data(String username, int amount) {\n        this.username = username;\n        this.amount = amount;\n    }\n    public String getUsername() {\n        return this.username;\n    }\n    public setUsername(String username) {\n        this.username = username;\n    }\n    public int getAmount() {\n        return this.amount;\n    }\n    public setAmount(int amount) {\n        this.amount = amount;\n    }\n    public Data createMemo() {\n        return new Data(this.username, this.amount);\n    }\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Data data = new Data(\"Alice\", 15);\n    Data memo = data.createMemo();\n    data.setUsername(\"Bob\");\n    if (submit(data) == false) {\n        // revert the data to the original state\n        data.setUsername(memo.getUsername());\n        // or we can just replace the object with the memo which \n        // depends on the context\n    }\n}\nComposite Pattern\nComposite Pattern combines objects into a tree structure to represent the \"part-whole\" hierarchy.\npublic interface Component {\n    void add(Component c);\n    void remove(Component c);\n    void display(int depth);\n}\n\nclass Leaf implements Component {\n    private String name;\n\n    public Leaf(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void add(Component c) {\n        // do nothing since it's a leaf node\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void remove(Component c) {\n        // do nothing since it's a leaf node\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void display(int depth) {\n        System.out.println(new String(new char[depth]).replace(\"\\0\", \"-\") + \" \" + name);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Composite implements Component {\n    private List list = new ArrayList<>();\n    private String name;\n\n    public Composite(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void add(Component c) {\n        list.add(c);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void remove(Component c) {\n        list.remove(c);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void display(int depth) {\n        System.out.println(new String(new char[depth]).replace(\"\\0\", \"-\") + \" \" + name);\n        for (Component c : list) {\n            c.display(depth);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Composite root = new Composite(\"root\");\n    root.add(new Leaf(\"Left\"));\n    root.add(new Leaf(\"Right\"));\n\n    root.display(1);\n}\nActually it's a preorder tree traversal which can be implemented as\nclass Node {\n    private List leaves = new ArrayList<>();\n    private String name;\n\n    public Node(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public void add(Node node) {\n        this.leaves.add(node);\n    }\n\n    public void remove(Node node) {\n        this.leaves.remove(node);\n    }\n\n    public void visit(int depth) {\n        System.out.println(new String(new char[depth]).replace(\"\\0\", \"-\") + \" \" + name);\n        for (Node n : this.leaves) {\n            n.visit(depth + 1);\n        }\n    }\n}\nIterator Pattern\nIn Java there are Iterator interface and Iterable interface. The Iterable requires an implementation of Iterator iterator(); to return an Iterator object. The Iterator requires the implementation of boolean hasNext(); and T next(); methods.\nclass Ledger implements Iterable {\n    private String[] records = new String[] { \"1st record\", \"2nd record\", \"3rd record\" };\n\n    @Override\n    public Iterator iterator() {\n        return new RecordIterator(0);\n    }\n\n    private class RecordIterator implements Iterator {\n        private int pos;\n\n        RecordIterator(int pos) {\n            this.pos = pos;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public boolean hasNext() {\n            return this.pos  iterator = ledger.iterator();\n    while(iterator.hasNext()) {\n        String record = iterator.next();\n        System.out.println(record);\n    }\n}\nMediator Pattern\npublic interface Participant {\n    void send(String msg);\n    void receive(String msg);\n}\n\nclass Mediator {\n    private Participant[] participants;\n\n    public Mediator(Participant a, Participant b) {\n        this.participants = new Participant[] { a, b };\n    }\n\n    public void send(String msg, Participant sender) {\n        if (sender == this.participants[0]) {\n            this.participants[1].recieve(msg);\n        } else {\n            this.participants[0].recieve(msg);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass Person implements Participant {\n    private Mediator mediator;\n    public Person(Mediator mediator) {\n        this.mediator = mediator;\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void send(String msg) {\n        this.mediator.send(msg, this);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void receive(String msg) {\n        System.out.println(msg);\n    }\n}\nHere the implementation is one to one, obviously the business case might be many-to-many, and then the logic wrapped inside the mediator would be more complicated.\nPrinciples\nSRP\nSingle Responsibility Principle.\nOpen-Close Principle\n\nOpen to extension\nClosed to modification\n\nDependency Inversion Principle\nInterface-oriented programming.\nLoD Principle\nThe Law of Demeter (LoD) or principle of least knowledge is a design guideline for developing software, particularly object-oriented programs.\nReference\n\n"},"blogs/tech/2021/2021-01-08-gcp-products/2021-01-08-gcp-products.html":{"url":"blogs/tech/2021/2021-01-08-gcp-products/2021-01-08-gcp-products.html","title":"GCP Products","summary":"GCP Products","keywords":"","body":"GCP Products\n\n"},"blogs/tech/2020/2020-10-31-python-metaclass.html":{"url":"blogs/tech/2020/2020-10-31-python-metaclass.html","title":"Python Metaclass","summary":"python metaclass","keywords":"","body":"Python Metaclass\nhuh... metaclass, isn't it the singleton class in ruby?\nJust feel more and more the same for Ruby and Python in the class of class, everything is an object, etc.\nWOW...\nIn python 2\nclass Foo(Bar):\n    pass\nPython will look for metaclass in the class definition.

However to my surprise, I accidently found that the class method can be invoked from a instance,\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nclass Parent:\n    @classmethod\n    def kls_whoami(cls):\n        print('class')\n    def whoami(self):\n        print('instance')     \n\nclass Child(Parent):\n    def __init__(self):\n        print('init')\n\n\nc = Child()\nc.whoami() # instance\nChild.kls_whoami() # class\nc.kls_whoami() # class -> ? why\nI was shocked because it never happens in JavaScript, Ruby or other languages that I know, and it seems to have broken the principle of encapsulation - how come a class method can be called from an object, why is it so special and and what's the differences between Python and other languages' inheritance models?\nAs the questions haunting around my mind, I decided to dig into it.\nWhy Ruby and JavaScript do not have this problem\nOne of the efficient study pattern is learning through comparison. I picked Ruby and JavaScript for this purpose in this case.\nRuby\nFirst of all let's check the Ruby's inheritance model. \nMy test is based on \nTested in irb,\n#!/usr/bin/ruby -w\nclass Parent\n  def self.kls_whoami\n    puts 'class'\n  end\n\n  def whoami\n    puts 'instance'\n  end\nend\n\nclass Child and the inheritance model is\n  \nWhen c.whoami is invoked, the search chain is \n\ncheck if object c's singleton_class #c has the whoami method \nif it's not there, it goes up to the ancestor chain - Child class\nif not found in Child, it would check the Parent class. Here we find the instance method whoami\nNoMethodError would be throw if there're no method with this signature found\n\nWhen Child.kls_whoami is invoked, the search chain is    \n\ncheck if the Child class's singleton_class #Child contains the kls_whoami\nif not, climb up to its superclass, #Parent. Here we find the class method kls_whoami\n\nThrough the analysis we know the instance methods and class methods live in different namespaces - the singleton_class of the object / the class and the singleton class of the class. And isolation ensures no static methods will be touch when called on an instance of that class.\nJavaScript\nWe will do the similar analysis on JavaScript, which is famous for the prototype pattern in inheritance model,\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nclass Parent {\n    static klsWhoami() {\n        console.log('class')\n    }    \n\n    whoami() { \n        console.log('instance')\n    }    \n}\n\nclass Child extends Parent {\n}\n\nlet c = new Child();\nc.whoami(); # instance\nChild.klsWhoami(); # class\nc.klsWhoami(); # TypeError: c.klsWhoami is not a function\nand the inheritance model is\n  \nWhen c.whoami() is invoked, the search chain is \n\ncheck if Child.prototype contains the instance method\nif not, climb up to the Parent.prototype. Here we find the whoami() instance method\n\nWhen Child.klsWhoami() is invoked, the search chain is      \n\ncheck if Child function / constructor contains the class method\nif not, check its ancestor Parent to see if it's there. Here we find the klsWhoami class method\n\nSimilarly we know now in JavaScript, instance methods and class methods exist in different namespace, so that when call the klsWhoami() method on c object, TypeError: c.klsWhoami is not a function will be throw.\nHow is Python's inheritance model\nIn Python, Class and instance methods live in the same namespace, it also enforces that the signature of instance methods and class/static methods cannot be the same.\nThe magic that transforms your obj.method(args) call into method(obj, args) is inside a .get() implementation of the function object that is, in fact, a non-data descriptor.\nThis works for regular instance methods just like it does for class methods or static methods. So, if you call a static method with obj.method(args), then it’s automatically transformed into method(args). Similarly, if you call a class method with obj.method(type(obj), args), then it’s automatically transformed into method(type(obj), args).\nReference: (Python Descriptors: An Introduction)\n\nMuch simpler, right?\nWhen c.whoami() is invoked, the search chain will\n\ncheck if the instance's namespace contains the method. Here we find the bound method and using the descriptor to access the method, the descriptor will help to call the method using Parent.whoami(c)\nOtherwise, check if the type of the instance and see if the type's namespace contains the method\nif still not found, escalate through the chain until it reach the end\n\nWhen c.kls_whoami() is called, the search chain will\n\ncheck if the instance's namespace contains the method. Here we find the bound method and using the descriptor to access the method, the descriptor will help to call the method using Parent.kls_whoami(type(c))\nOtherwise, check if the type of the instance and see if the type's namespace contains the method\nif still not found, escalate through the chain until it reach the end\n\nChild.kls_whoami() and Parent.kls_whoami() is similar except that they are starting from the namespace of Child class and Parent class respectively.\nBoth the class method and the instance method live in the Parant class's namespace, and the built-in non-data descriptor will help the instance to find the bound methods and convert the instance called upon to the arguments required by the method. For these reasons, a class method can be called on a python object instance without throwing any exceptions.\n"},"blogs/tech/2020/2020-02-18-mvvm-vs-redux/2020-02-18-mvvm-vs-redux.html":{"url":"blogs/tech/2020/2020-02-18-mvvm-vs-redux/2020-02-18-mvvm-vs-redux.html","title":"MVVM vs Redux","summary":"MVVM vs Redux","keywords":"","body":"MVVM vs Redux\n\n\nAuthor: Damon Yuan\nDate: 2020-02-18\nReference: Introduction to Redux in Flutter\n\n\nMost of a pattern in a Framework is designed to decouple the components as much as possible and the ways to achieve it are mainly two, \n\nusing synchronized interfaces\nusing asynchronized messages\n\n  \n  \n\nIoC: Inverse of Control - \"Don't call us, we will call you\"\nDI: Dependency Injection\nAOP: Aspect Oriented Programming\n With AOP, you still define the common functionality in one place, but you can declaratively define how and where this functionality is applied without having to modify the class to which you’re applying the new feature.

It's helpful for layman to grasp the basic concepts and feel the benefits it will bring - smaller application, easier development, and faster delivery, however sometimes it also covers the complexity behind it.\nThe Patterns\nIMHO, the microservice architecture patterns at least include the following aspects,\n\n\n\n\nPattern\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCore\nwhich language, which framework to use\n\n\nConfiguration Management\nhow to manage the configuration and reflect the changes in deployment\n\n\nAsynchronous Messaging\nhow to deliver asynchronous message\n\n\nService Discovery\nhow to discover a service in the distributed cluster\n\n\nService Routing\nhow to manage the incoming and outgoing traffic in a traceable manner\n\n\nClient-side Load Balancing\na service is normally backed by serveral app instances, server side proxy will inevitably introduce a single point of failure because all the traffic to the service has to go through it. The way to solve it is to use a client-side load-balancing to distribute the traffic to the service instances from the client side and with the predefined poliy\n\n\nCircuit Breaker\nif an upstream service is down, should its clients keep retrying until all the thread resource is exhausted and the client also becomes irresponsibe? It's clear that the answer is no, and circuit breaker helps the client to trip off the connection for a while to protect it from being dragged into the same mire if it find that the target service has some problems. It will also poll the upstream service to check if it's back and functional every several secs / mins. If yes, it will recover the connection when possible.\n\n\nFallback\nfallback to some other endpoints / error messages / solutions if something wrong with the upstream service\n\n\nBulkhead\na bulkhead is an upright wall within the hull of a ship or within the fuselage of an aeroplane. It devides functional areas into smaller rooms and create water tight compartments that can contain water in case of a hull breach or other leak. The bulkhead pattern in the microservice architecture will divide the threads of a client service into isolated pools based on the number of its consuming services. If one of its consuming service is down, it will only possibly use up the threads in the pool dedicated to that upstream service and prevent it from being taken down because of out of resource.\n\n\nCI\ncompile, testing, building ans storage\n\n\nCD\ndeployment\n\n\nLog Aggregation\ncollect metrics & logs from distributed nodes and services\n\n\nLog Correlation and Tracing\ncorrelate the logs to trace the requests so that an user's behavior can be reproduced\n\n\nAuthentication & Authorization\nsecure the cluster\n\n\nCredential Management and Encryption\nhow to manage the credential that should be unaccessible from unauthorized folks\n\n\n\nIf all these still cannot demonstrate the complexity of the microservice architecture, read this -> Back to Microservice with Istio. Lucky that I'm not the only person who has this feeling.\nThe Comparison\nIn Netflix Stack, most of the patterns mentioned above are implemented as a lib or a framework, and the developers will need to directly provision the service, integrate the library, and customize the code in the application. In Kubernetes + Istio solution, the sidecar pattern is used so that the application can be deployed into the cluster as normal application without knowing the details of patterns in microservice architecture - all those are taken care by Istio.\n\n\n\nPatterns\nNetflix\nK8S + istio\n\n\n\n\nCore\nSpringBoot\nany language, any framework\n\n\nConfiguration\nSpring Config\nK8S ConfigMap & Secret\n\n\nAsynchronous Messaging\nSpring Cloud Stream\nany messaging engine / provider\n\n\nService Discovery\nSpring Cloud Eureka\nK8S Service + Istio VirtualService + Istio DestinationRule\n\n\nService Routing\nSpring Cloud Gateway\nIstio Ingress / Egress\n\n\nClient-side Load-balancing\nRibbon + Feign\nIstio Envoy\n\n\nCircuit Breaker\nHystrix\nIstio Envoy\n\n\nFallback\nHystrix\nNo, Envoy will return the error code the the application need to handle it\n\n\nBulkhead\nHystrix\nNo, but K8S resource limit can mitigate it\n\n\nCI\nany, normally Jenkins\nany, normally Jenkins\n\n\nCD\nany, normally Jenkins\nany, but more options, eg., K8S native, Spinnaker, Helm, Kustomize\n\n\nLog Aggregation\nSpring Cloud Sleuth\nIstio\n\n\nLog Correlation and Tracing\nSpring Cloud Sleuth + Zipkin\nIstio and many plugins, by default Prometheus + Grafana\n\n\nAuthentication & Authorization\nSpring Cloud Security + OAuth2 / JWT\nIstio Security\n\n\nCredential Management and Encryption\nSpring Cloud Security\nK8S Secret + plugins\n\n\n\nLast but not the least, the relationship between K8S and Istio is not \"either... or...\", it is \"both... and...\" - we can setup the istio in a cluster while with istio's functions disabled/enabled in different namespaces.

This character is perfect for setting up shadowsocks in cluster because the bandwidth is limited on each node, having more than one working pod on a single node will gain no more benifit than having more worker threads in the ShadowSocks container within the single pod.\nLoadBalancer\nLoadBalancer is backed by NodePort which improves the efficiency by reducing the hops.

Note that if no local pods exist, the connection will hang and won't be forwarded to a random global pod.\nConfiguration\nThe configuration for ShadowSocks and kcptun is placed inside the config folder.

For more details please refer to ShadowsocksX-NG.\n\n\nQ&A\n\nWhy not using VPN?\nVPN's traffic characteristics is quite significant and easy to be detected. In some area it is not viable because the IP would be blocked if the traffic has been identified as VPN. \n\nWhy not SSH tunnel?\nMostly it is about the stability and performance. SSH Tunnel requires the connection to be maintained, which makes it almost unusable when using cellular network over a mobile phone and traveling in a vehicle. Another thing is about the performance, while I think it is just a minor issue for normal usage. To be honest I feel no difference when using SSH tunnel solution compared to the plain ShadowSocks (no kcptun) one.\n\n\n"},"blogs/tech/2020/2020-01-31-wuhan-coronavirus-timeline-api/2020-01-31-wuhan-coronavirus-timeline-api.html":{"url":"blogs/tech/2020/2020-01-31-wuhan-coronavirus-timeline-api/2020-01-31-wuhan-coronavirus-timeline-api.html","title":"A Test App with Istio","summary":"A Test App with Istio","keywords":"","body":"A Test App with Istio\n\n\nAuthor: Damon Yuan\nDate: 2020-01-30\n\n\n\nRecently the situation of Wuhan Coronavirus is getting serious, more and more foreign friends are aware of it and taking preventive measures to protect themselves from getting infected.

However sometimes there are always questions popping up about this role, like \"what is the difference between an Architect and a Lead Developer\", \"what is the responsibility for an architect\". Here is my understanding of the Architect role along with other roles in a Dev Team, \n\nThe architect’s job is to see the big picture and understand how an application can be decomposed into individual microservices and how the microservices will interact to deliver a solution.\nA project’s architect focuses on three key tasks:\n\nDecomposing the business problem\n\nDescribe the business problem, and listen to the nouns you’re using to describe the problem.\nPay attention to the verbs.\nLook for data cohesion. Microservices should completely own their data.\n\n\nEstablishing service granularity\n\nIt’s better to start broad with your microservice and refactor to smaller services\nFocus first on how your services will interact with one another\nService responsibilities will change over time as your understanding of the problem domain grows\n\n\nDefining the service interfaces\n\n\nIf the definition is still obscure and difficult to be understood, I have also prepared some examples here,\nExample One: Before starting a new project\nBefore starting a project, we need to decide the tech stack for the project, for example, whether to use monolithic pattern or microservice pattern. If the microservice pattern is chosen, an Architect need to consider the following topics before the developers starting to write the code,\n\nIt's worthy to mention that the logging system is as important as that of the required functions and should be taken into consideration in the very beginning. One thing I learned from Automation Control Theorem is that a controlled system should always provide the feedback, including the metrics, the logs, and the tracing. It is also very important to have a centric monitoring system to collect, analysis, visualize the data and send alerts when necessary, like ELK/EFK stack, Prometheus with Grafana, etc.\nExample Two: Before adding a new feature to a existing project\nWhen a feature is recommended by a Business Analyst, a design document should be prepare beforehand so that the developers can understand what to do and the Scrum Masters know the exact definition of done.

One way to measure the messiness is to using Gini Impurity, as mentioned in A Simple Explanation of Gini Impurity.\nHowever here we are going to use another way, using Information Gain from ID3 algorithm.\nInformation Gain\nInformation Gain is the measure of the difference in Entropy from before to after the set S is split on an attribute A. In other words, how much uncertainty in S was reduced after splitting set S on attribute A, the more uncertainty reduced the better the split is. the formula is defined as follow,\nIG(S,A)=H(S)−∑t∈Tp(t)H(t)=H(S)−H(S∣A)\n  IG(S, A) = H(S) - \\sum_{t\\in T}p(t)H(t) = H(S) - H(S|A)\nIG(S,A)=H(S)−​t∈T​∑​​p(t)H(t)=H(S)−H(S∣A)  \n  Where,\n\nH(S) – Entropy of set S\nT - The subsets created from splitting set S by attribute A, such that S=⋃t∈TtS = \\bigcup_{t\\in T}tS=⋃​t∈T​​t \np(t) - The proportion of the number of elements in t to the number of elements in set S\nH(t) - Entropy of subset t\n\nWhen we know how to calculate the Information Gain, we can split our data across every feature of the classes to see which split gives us the highest Information Gain. The split with the highest Information Gain is our best option.\nBefore we can measure the best split and start splitting our data, we need to know how to calculate the Information Gain. The measure of information of a set is known as the Shannon Entropy, or just Entropy for short. Its name comes from the father of information theory, Claude Shannon. Entropy is a measure of the amount of uncertainty in the data set S. The higher the Entropy, the more mixed up the data is.\nThe formula for the calculation of Entropy is defined as\nH(S)=−∑xi∈X,i=1Np(xi)log2p(xi)\nH(S) = -\\sum_{x_i\\in X, i = 1}^Np(x_i)log_2p(x_i)\nH(S)=−​x​i​​∈X,i=1​∑​N​​p(x​i​​)log​2​​p(x​i​​)\n  Where,\n\nS - The current dataset for which Entropy is being calculated\nX - The set of classes in S \np(x) p(x) p(x) - the proportion of the number of elements in class x to the number of elements in Set S \nlog2p(x) log_2p(x) log​2​​p(x) - the information for class x\nN is the number of classes\n\nAfter the formula of Entropy is defined, we can start to calculate the Information Gain for some simple examples.   \nExamples\nTraining a decision tree consists of iteratively splittin gthe current data into two branches. Say we had the following data points: \n\nRight now, we have 1 branch with 5 blues and 5 greens.

While in node.js the bound address is 0.0.0.0. So what is the difference between these two IP addresses?\nIP Address Classification\nBefore explaining the difference between the two addresses, let's review the basics of IP addresses.\nIP Address Representation\nAn IP address consists of two parts, net-id and host-id, which are the network number and host number. Net-id specifies the network number where the IP address is located. Host-id indicates the host number on the network where the IP address is located.\nwhich is:\n IP-address ::= { ,  }\nIP Address Classification\nThe IP addresses are classified into five categories from A to E. The classification is based on the byte length occupied by the net-id and the first few bits of the network number.\n\nClass A: The network number occupies 1 byte. The first digit of the network number is fixed at 0.\nClass B: The network number occupies 2 bytes. The first two digits of the network number are fixed at 10.\nClass C: The network number occupies 3 bytes. The first three fixed bits of the network number are 110.\nClass D: The first four digits are 1110, which is used for multicast, that is, one-to-many communication.\nClass E: The first four digits are 1111 and are reserved for future use. Among them, ABC three types of addresses are unicast addresses, which are used for one-to-one communication and are most commonly used.\n\nSpecial IP Address\nSpecial IP addresses are used to do something special. The following special IP addresses are defined in RFC1700.\n\n{0,0}: Both the Network-number and the Host-number are 0, which means \"this host on this network\" and it can only be used as the source address.\n{0, host-id}: A host on this network. Can only be used as a source address.\n{-1,-1}: indicates that all bits of the network number and host number are 1. It is used for broadcast on this network and can only be used as the destination address. Packets sent to this address cannot be forwarded to the networks other than the source network.\n{net-id,-1}: Broadcast directly to the specified network. Can only be used as the destination address.\n{net-id, subnet-id, -1}: Broadcast directly to the specified subnet of the specified network. Can only be used as the destination address.\n{net-id,-1,-1}: Broadcast directly to all subnets of the specified network. Can only be used as the destination address.\n{127,}: Any IP address with a network number of 127. All the IP addresses of this type are internal host loopback, that can never appear on a network outside the host.\n\nQuestions and answers\nNext, let's look at the question that was asked before: What is the difference between the 127.0.0.1 and 0.0.0.0 addresses? Let's first look at the commonalities:\n\nAll belong to a special address.\nBoth belong to the class A address: 01111111 and 00000000.\nBoth are IPV4 addresses.\n\nNext we look at the two addresses separately.\n0.0.0.0\nIn IPV4, the 0.0.0.0 address is used to indicate an invalid, unknown or unavailable target.\n\nIn the server, 0.0.0.0 refers to all IPV4 addresses on the local machine. If a host has two IP addresses, 192.168.1.1 and 10.1.2.1, and the address monitored by a service on the host is 0.0.0.0, Then the service can be accessed through both the IP addresses.\n\nIn the route, 0.0.0.0 indicates the default route, that is, the route used when an exact match cannot be found in the routing table.\n\n\nSummary of usage,\n\nWhen a host has not been assigned an IP address, it is used to indicate the host itself. For example, before an IP address is assigned by DHCP.\nUsed as a default route, meaning \"any IPV4 host\", which indicates that the target machine is not available.\nUsed as a server to represent any IPV4 address on this machine.\n\n127.0.0.1\n127.0.0.1 belongs to the {127,} collection, and all addresses with a network number of 127 are called loopback addresses. \n\nLoopback address: All packets destined for this type of address should be loop back.\n\nSummary of usage,\n\nLoopback test, by using ping 127.0.0.1 to test the network device on a machine, the operating system or TCP/IP implementation is working properly.\nDDos attack defense: After receiving the DDos attack, change the domain A record to 127.0.0.1, which force the attackers to attack themselves.\nMost web containers bind themselves to it when working in testing or development environment\n\nlocalhost\nCompared to 127.0.0.1, more meaning has been assigned to localhost. localhost is a domain name, not an IP address. The reason why we often think that localhost and 127.0.0.1 is the same because most of the articles tell that the localhost points to the address of 127.0.0.1. In the ubuntu system, the /ets/hosts file will have the following content:\n127.0.0.1 localhost \n127.0.1.1 damon-mac \n\n# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts \n::1 IP6-localhost IP6-loopback \nfe00::0 IP6-localnet \nff00::0 IP6-mcastprefix \nff02::1 IP6-allnodes \nff02::2 IP6-allrouters\nThe first line above is the default configuration that will be available on almost every computer. But the meaning of localhost is not limited to 127.0.0.1.\nlocalhost is a domain name and it is used to refer to this computer or this host, and can be used to obtain network services running on this machine. In most systems, localhost is pointed to IPV4's 127.0.0.1 and IPV6's ::1.\n127.0.0.1 localhost \n::1 localhost\nTherefore, pay attention to confirm the protocol is IPV4 or IPV6 when using the localhost.\nSummary\n127.0.0.1 is a loopback address, it does not mean \"this machine\". 0.0.0.0 is the real expression of \"this machine in this network.\" Normally we choose to bind to 0.0.0.0 when the server wants to bind the port. In this way the service can be accessed by multiple IP addresses.\nFor example, I have setup a server with an external network address A and an internal network address B. If the port I bind to is specified as 0.0.0.0, my application can be accessed through both the internal network address and the external network address.

Some languages, like Clojure, make all values immutable by default. Any “mutating” operations copy the value, change it and pass back the changed copy. This eliminates bugs that arise from a programmer’s incomplete model of the possible states their program may enter.\n\nfirst class functions\nLanguages that support first class functions allow functions to be treated like any other value. This means they can be created, passed to functions, returned from functions and stored inside data structures.\n\ntail call optimisation\nTail call optimisation is a programming language feature. Each time a function recurses, a new stack frame is created. A stack frame is used to store the arguments and local values for the current function invocation. If a function recurses a large number of times, it is possible for the interpreter or compiler to run out of memory. Languages with tail call optimisation reuse the same stack frame for their entire sequence of recursive calls. Languages like Python that do not have tail call optimisation generally limit the number of times a function may recurse to some number in the thousands. In the case of the race() function, there are only five time steps, so it is safe.\n\nprogramming techniques used to write functional code\n\nmapping\n\nreducing\n\npipelining\n\nrecursing\n\ncurrying\nCurrying means decomposing a function that takes multiple arguments into a function that takes the first argument and returns a function that takes the next argument, and so forth for all the arguments.\n\nhigher order functions\n\nadvantageous properties of functional programs\n\nparallelization\nParallelization means running the same code concurrently without synchronization.

Normally if you want to apply the Asia-pacific businese to Europe, even if the application logic is exactly the same, it is better to create a new instance in EU zone and change the base url to the new server in order to achieve faster network connection. This also applies to mainland China.\nRecently I have an application that require api support inside mainland China and I am using docker. At begining, I think what I need to do is just to find a VPC provider there,  upload the code I deployed in AWS, and run the command docker-compose up -d, then everything should be fine in the backend.\nBut I encountered so many problems during the process and this article provides some experience and hope it will help someone who would do the same task and save some time for the gym.\n1. The first thing, GFW (Great Fire Wall)\nI never heard about it...YOU SHOULD READ ABOUT IT THEN.\n\nThe Great Firewall of China (abbreviated to GFW) is the combination of legislative and technological actions that have been taken by the government of Mainland China (which is controlled by the Communist Party of China, CPC) to regulate the Internet domestically. It is the main instrument used by the government to achieve Internet censorship in China. These CPC regulations include criminalizing certain online speech and activities, blocking from view selected websites, filtering key words out of searches initiated from computers located in Mainland China, requiring international online service provider store their Chinese customer information within China, and slowing down cross-border internet traffic.\n\nThe reason is complicated and the fact is not easy to be changed recently, that's why the network connection to access some websites outside the mainland China is slow and some are even not accessible, e.g., www.youtube.com, www.google.com.\nNowadays in software industry, many package management tool is developed to make developers' life easier. We can see Homebrew for Mac, Apt-get for Ubuntu, NPM for javascript, gem for ruby, etc. Because of the GFW, all connections to the server outside mainland China is relatively slow, which makes it hard for developers to fetch the packages, tools, libs from remote. An incidence happened in September 2015, XcodeGhost, is actually caused by the slow network speed in mainland china and the developers there looked for local copies for Apple Xcode development environment, and encountered altered versions that had been posted on domestic web sites.\nWhen using docker, normally only the code write by ourselves will be added into the image through Dockerfile.  Libraries used by the application are usually fetched directly through package manager.  Here is a example of Dockerfile:\n  FROM ruby:2.3\n\n  RUN apt-get update \\\n    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \\\n    postgresql-client \\\n    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n  WORKDIR /usr/src/app\n  COPY Gemfile* ./\n  RUN bundle install\n  COPY . .\n\n  EXPOSE 3000\n  CMD [\"rails\", \"server\", \"-b\", \"0.0.0.0\"]\nThe linux package is installed through apt-get, and the gems used by the application is installed through bundle install.\n2. The second thing, ICP (Internet Content Provider) license\nYou still need to read a little more if you do not want your connection being blocked mysteriously all of a sudden. Information about MAINLAND CHINA ICP.\nGenaral speaking, all websites with their own domain name that operate inside mainland China are required to obtain a licence, and China-based Internet service providers are required to block the site if a licence is not acquired within a grace period.\nIf your backend is just API server and do not need a domain for the website, then the regulation might be circumvented by using ip address and port directly. But this approach has not been confirmed. Some of the VPC provider might help to apply for an ICP license with some files uploaded. As I know, qcloud from Tencent is one of them.\n3. The last thing, VPC providers.\nhere I have picked some of the best choices:\n\nqcloud from Tencent\naliyun from Alibaba\nAWS from AWS China\n\nHere I selected Tecent because they can help me on the ICP license. As I have metioned before, I just upload all my source code there and run docker-compose up -d, hope things setup magically.\nBut...\n\nThere are so many problem during the shipment. Here are the pitfalls that I have get myself in and I hope you guys do not get the shit hit the fan again... I was using qcloud from Tencent and here are the detailed steps I had gone through.\n\n1. Choose the right configuration for the host machine.\nI got myself used to aws and normally I will setup a small instance to do some test until I feel good enough and then adjust its configuration to the scale I need. So I choose the most basic configuration on qcloud as well: Series 1, 1 core-cpu, 1G memory, 1Mbps network, local hard disk for system. However some of the configuration cannot be upgraded after selected, and there is no obvious instruction on that(at least I didn't see it).\nThe first problem I encounter is 1G memory is not enough to run docker-compose up -d, in the command line it syas:\nfatal error: runtime: out of memory\nRemember to set at least 2G memory for your instance if you want to run docker inside it.\nAt first, I think it is fine because I thought I can adjust the configuration and upgrade the machine.\nBut...\n\n\nSorry, you cannot change the configuration after you choose local disk and you cannot adjust disk size and you cannot change the disk type from local to cloud, and I have paied the machine for the next half year because it is cheaper if not based on usage but on contract.\nTo sum it up, take care to do the configuration before you set it up, for docker to build smoothly inside the machine, at least 2GB memory should be allocated, and choose the cloud disk rather than local disk other than you have justified reasons. And the experience is based on qclound, as to aliyum and aws China, please google more and if you got some experience on them, please share with others.\n\n2. Installing the docker in the right way\nBecause the network connecting to other parts of the world in mainland China is slow, different VPC providers have provided accelerate script to help fetching the dockers images. \nHere is the link for how to do it in qcloud. What a pity that they didn't provide a script for automatically installation yet, so I use aliyum's script here.\ncurl -sSL http://acs-public-mirror.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/docker-engine/internet | sh -\nIt is better to add default user into docker group to prevent input sudo everytime.\nsudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu\nAfter all these done, the image fetching process will be much faster, and you can build you image with VPN in your local machine if you are inside mainland China network, and push it to docker-hub registry, and fetch it afterward.\n\n3. Do not build the image inside the host\nOfficially docker image should be built and push to registry before usage, but some guys still prefer to build it after all the source code pushed to the VPC. If the virtual machine has good access to the network it is fine under most cases, but if the network is inside the mainland China, you will find that the terminal always hang up there when you are fetch some libraries from remote. I had experienced that when the bundle install tries to fetch gems. I interrupted the process many time and tried to do it again, but still failed. Finally, my solution is to build it in my local machine and push it to docker-hub. \nThere are more than one way that can help prevent this problem:\n1. Docker registry\nyou can use docker-hub or event create your own registry, build it in a machine that has good internet access, and push the image to the registry. \n2. ShadowSocks (or GoAgent)\nShadowSocks is a good thing for developers in mainland China. To use it, you have to rent a machine outside mainland China. I initiated an instance in AWS singapore zone and install the tool using the command: \n$ pip install shadowsocks\nBecause shadowsocks need to create a .pid file in /var/run folder which is owned by root, it needs to be installed in root.\n$ sudo -i\n$ python --version\nPython 2.6.8\n$ pip install shadowsocks\n$ vi /etc/shadowsocks.json\n{\n\"server\":\"0.0.0.0\", // many tutorial tell you to input the real ip of your vm, but actually you should put \"0.0.0.0\" here. Reason??? However in client side you need to fill the relastic ip into the proxy server configuration.\n\"server_port\":8388, // the remote port, you will fill it in client proxy server configuration\n\"local_address\":\"127.0.0.1\", // the local ip\n\"local_port\":1080,  // the local port\n\"password\":\"xxxx\", // password\n\"timeout\":300, // timeout\n\"method\":\"rc4-md5\", // encryption method\n\"fast_open\": false， // https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks/wiki/TCP-Fast-Open and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_Fast_Open\n\"workers\": 2\n}\n$ ssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks.json -d start // start server in detach mode\n$ echo 'sudo ssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks.json -d start' >> /etc/rc.d/rc.local // start the ss server when system reboot\n$ exit\nAnd in client side (the virtual machine inside mainland China), client configuration is as follows:\n$ sudo -i\n$ python --version\nPython 2.6.8\n$ pip install shadowsocks\n$ vi /etc/shadowsocks.json\n{\n\"server\":\"xxxx\", // here is the relastic ip of your server\n\"server_port\":8388, // the remote port, you will fill it in client proxy server configuration\n\"local_address\":\"127.0.0.1\", // the local ip\n\"local_port\":1080,  // the local port\n\"password\":\"xxxx\", // password\n\"timeout\":300, // timeout\n\"method\":\"rc4-md5\", // encryption method\n}\n$ exit\ncheck if the client work\n$ sudo systemctl status rc-local.service\nthen during docker build,  you can start the client by\n$ sudo sslocal -c /etc/shadowsocks.json -d start\nIt enable the proxy globally and after docker build is done, you can turn the proxy off by: \n$ sudo sslocal -c /etc/shadowsocks.json -d stop\n3. VPN\nYou can setup some VPN in the machine you are going to deploy to. I have not tried this method yet but I think it should have the same effects as the ShadowSocks.\nDo not use orginal OpenVPN!! The GFW can distinguish the packet of OpenVPN and once found your ip address will be blocked immediately. There are some mutated version can be used, e.g., SoftEther VPN.\nThe main difference between ShadowSocks and VPN is that only the TCP/UDP traffic is going through the tunnel of the two virtual machines in ShadowSocks, while for VPN all the traffic will go throught your service provider.\n\n4. Better to do\nUntil now the docker application should have been setup and run as expected, but there are two more tips that worth some attention:\n\nAdd swapfile for the system\nUsing nginx as proxy so that the machine can host more than one docker application and set the upload file limite, etc.\n\n\nHope this article can save some time for those who wanna deploy the application with docker in mainland China network.\n"},"blogs/tech/2017/2017-07-01-Test-with-iOS.html":{"url":"blogs/tech/2017/2017-07-01-Test-with-iOS.html","title":"Test with iOS","summary":"This article tries to generalize the best practice of testing with iOS project.","keywords":"","body":"Test with iOS\n\n\nAuthor: Damon Yuan\nDate: 2017-07-01\n\n\nThis article tries to generalize the best practice of testing with iOS project.\n1. Functional reactive programming\n1.1 What is functional?\n\nIn functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x will produce the same result f(x) each time; this is in contrast to procedures depending on a local or global state, which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state.\n\nOne of the most important parts of functional programming is that when the input is decided, the output is also determined. In other words, the functions are referential transparency.\n1.2 What is Reactive?\n\nSystems using an assembly line concurrency model are also sometimes called reactive systems, or event driven systems. The system's workers react to events occurring in the system, either received from the outside world or emitted by other workers. Examples of events could be an incoming HTTP request, or that a certain file finished loading into memory etc.\n\nReactive is an assembly line with independent workers dealing with different types of events. It helps divide the programming into a fine-grained subroutine like services in distributed system.\nActors and channels are two similar examples of assembly line (or reactive / event driven) models.\n\n\n1.3 What is functional reactive programming?\n\nFunctional Reactive Programming (FRP) integrates time flow and compositional events into functional programming. This provides an elegant way to express computation in domains such as interactive animations, robotics, computer vision, user interfaces, and simulation.\n\nHere is a link in Stackoverflow, which I think it has more detailed explanation about FRP.\nIn my understanding, FRP is a programming paradigm which combines functional and reactive together. This model handles continuous (Reactive) and deterministic (Functional) concurrency with ease and grace (generalized API design). The basic idea behind reactive programming is that there are certain datatypes that represent a value \"over time\". Computations that involve these changing-over-time values will themselves have values that change over time.\nThere is an excellent analogy: An easy way of reaching a first intuition about what it's like is to imagine your program is a spreadsheet and all of your variables are cells. If any of the cells in a spreadsheet change, any cells that refer to that cell change as well. It is functional because when the input is constant, the output of those related cells is also constant, there won't be a different result. It is reactive because cells react to an input event, which is bound with the time -- the value changes at some specific time.\n1.4 Why to use functional reactive programming?\n\nReactive Programming raises the level of abstraction of your code so you can focus on the interdependence of events that define the business logic, rather than having to constantly fiddle with plenty of implementation details. Code in RP will likely be more concise.\n\nImagine a basic scenario: user login. Normally there is two UITextField and one UIButton. In a non-reactive implementation, when a user interacts with the UITextField, callbacks will be invoked and inside the callback function, we can do some validation to check whether to enable login button or not. If the inputs are valid, we enable the login button and can send the request to the backend.\nIn reactive way, every component can be treated like a number, and the whole system can be treated like a math equation. In order to do it in iOS, the project structure needs to be MVVM, it means that every UI component need has a corresponding ViewModel which is a data structure reflecting the information of the UI component. And reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams, and a stream is a sequence of ongoing events ordered in time.\nOne of the reasons for efficiency lift from reactive is that the asynchronous event's sequence is perceptive in the program with a declarative way because behaviors/events are bound with time. For example, sometimes data A and data B has some relationship in business logic and the web page should only rerender after both A and B are updated. It is hard for non-reactive programming to know whether both A and B are updated because events are fired asynchronously, so normally the web app will rerender the whole page every time the update event received regardless of the event type. But it is easy for reactive programming to understand it and only rerender the view at the right time, and only render the view of which the ViweModel has the value changed.\n1.5 How to implement functional reactive programming in iOS?\nLibraries are already available in iOS:\nObjective C: ReactiveObjC\nSwift: ReactiveCocoa\nThe standard for reactive API is well defined and the API for the library is well documented. What we need to do is just to use Cocoapods or Carthage to integrate them into our projects.\nFor details about implementation please check the sample project.\n\n2. MVVM over MVC\nMVC\n\nMVVM\n\n2.1 MVVM is better compatible with FRP\nBecause in reactive way, every component can be treated as a data structure, it makes sense to create a ViewModel for each view component. In old traditional MVC, the model contains all the attributes based on backend API design, but not all of them are used in one specific view model. Mostly only part of those attributes is reflected in the view component. Extracting the ViewModel from the model is enabling true separation between the view and model. \nIt is good to simplify the business logic in a model, after the separation, models mainly take care about the data persistent and synchronization, like save data into SQLite, fetching data from remote backend and keeping remote and local data synchronized. For ViewModel, it mainly concerns about the data binding between view (Note: the view include View and ViewController in MVVM, because it only handles the rendering logic now) and ViewModel, and the view will render reactively based on the event from ViewModel.\n2.2 MVVM is easier for unit test\nIn MVC the controller is the hub of communication between models and views, which makes it clumsy and filled with both rendering logic and business logic. In MVVM the controller is much simpler because its only job is to rendering view and event the rendering logic is implemented in ViewModel. And it is much easier to test on ViewModel because is relatively independent compared with UIViewController, which has many life-cycle callbacks which will be called by the iOS system during runtime.\n\n3. Stub and Mock\n3.1 What is Mock and Stub\nStub: For replacing a method with code that returns a specified result.\nMock: A stub with an assertion that the method gets called.\nMocks look similar to Stubs, but Mocks Aren't Stubs.\nLong to be short, based on my understanding, the stub is a simple fake object, it just makes sure test runs smoothly, like stubbing a request using Nocilla, but we never test the stub itself.\nMock is a smarter stub, we verify our test passes through it. It waits to be called by the class under test, and it makes sure that it was contacted in exactly the right way, or the test will fail.\nExample in sample: \n// EtStationsTableViewCell.m\ncontext(@\"set view model after set the view model\", ^{\n        __block id chargingStationProtocolMock;\n        __block EtStationViewModel *viewModel;\n\n        beforeEach(^{\n            chargingStationProtocolMock = OCMProtocolMock(@protocol(EtChargingStationProtocol));\n            OCMStub([chargingStationProtocolMock getAddress]).andReturn(@\"stub address\");\n            viewModel = [[EtStationViewModel alloc] initWithStation:chargingStationProtocolMock];\n            [cell setViewModel:viewModel];\n        });\n\n        it(@\"textLabel should have no address as the station view model before bind\", ^{\n            expect([[cell textLabel] text]).to.beNil();\n        });\n\n        it(@\"textLabel should have address as the station view model after bind\", ^{\n            [cell bind];\n            OCMVerify([chargingStationProtocolMock getAddress]); // Mock\n            expect([[cell textLabel] text]).to.equal(@\"stub address\"); // Stub\n        });\n    });\n3.2 Hard path: Dependency Injection\nWhen the request helper method is declared as follows, we can use dependency injection to inject an HTTP client for the test, which will implement the stub logic inside the HTTP client.\n+ (RACSignal *)getStations:(EtHttpClient *)client parameters:(NSDictionary *)parameters;\nIt is not recommended for two reasons. First of all, we need to create another HTTP client for the test. Secondly, the HTTP client used in the application itself needs to be tested, which means we need to write more test case for the HTTP client.\n3.3 Easy path: Libraries\nIn this way, the HTTP client is the same as what is used in the applcation main target, but the request is intercepted and the response is injected with what we want. There are many ways to realize the implementation, and this is the Nocilla's way to achieve it.\nThere are many libs can achieve stubbing a HTTP requests, in the sample project Nocilla is used.\n\nNocilla\nOHHTTPStubs\n\n\n4. Unit test\nBy default, the unit test comes with XCTest. But I prefer BDD test with is more expressive and easier integrated with MVVM. So in the sample project, the following test libs are integrated:\n\nOCMock\nSpecta\nExpecta\n\nRuby On Rails is a web framework that really takes test serious, that's why I would like to adopt Rails structure for iOS unit tests:\n\nViewModel - tests for view models\nView - tests for views\nModel - tests for models\nController - tests for controllers\nUtils - tests for utils/helpers\n\nBut, where is the integration test? For integration test, the the API request should be real rather than stubbed so that we can check whether the api is integrated successfully or not in concrete. I think it is better to put it in UI test so that a visual impression will be presented.\n\n5. UI test\n5.1 XCUITest\nAs to XCUITest, it is easy to record some actions. There is one more point to pay attention to, the asynchronous request. Under different network conditions, the request will spend different time, this is especially important when we are using UI test as the integration test. We need to consider how long should we wait for the requests and set a timeout value for it.\nXCUITest official document\n5.2 KIF\nThis library provides more declarative API for UI test, but note that event though KIF is used to test your UI, you need to add it to your Unit Test target, not UI test target.\nKeep It Functional\n\n6. Code Coverage\nIf XCTest and XCUITest are used, the Xcode itself already has the Code Coverage Analysis tool integrated. But if using Specta and Expecta, we need have some kinds of third party tools involved.\nTools recommended:\n\nGcovr\n\n\n7. Static Analysis\nBy default, the Xcode comes with analyzer, and we can also use OCLint for Objective-C projects:\n\nOCLint\n\n\n8. Continuous Integration\n\nfastlane - Automated Deployment\n\nCI server choices: \n\nXcode CI server\njenkins CI server\nCircle/travis CI\n\n"},"series/":{"url":"series/","title":"Series","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nHere are my notes for different topics.\n"},"series/quantitative-trading-with-backtrader/":{"url":"series/quantitative-trading-with-backtrader/","title":"Quantitative Trading with Backtrader","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\n结合 backtrader 回测框架学习《Quantitative Trading -

做高频交易策略就不在讨论范围了，我也不会。\n\n交易资金\n划重点，重要。\n一是佣金。虽然现在佣金已经下降到很低了，但是始终还是影响是否盈利的一大因素。\n二是杠杠。交易期货，货币，期权一般有比股票更高的杠杠，但是天台见的概率也是更高的，而且杠杠率在一些市场还和交易类型是日内还是日外有关（不知道不明白不了解，纯粹翻译，请自行谷歌）。\n最后交易资金的大小也会影响交易类型：单边交易或是对冲交易。太少资金做对冲及时降低了风险，也降低了收益。\n另外一些影响譬如交易数据实时性（高大上高频交易专属，民工专区，高端勿扰），准确性（这里注意数据中的幸存者偏差，复权等问题，这些会导致回测不准确），在我们这个时代已经不是问题了。且不说免费的 Tushare, 即便是专业软件万德，在某宝上也是分分钟几十元搞定的事情。\n\n盈利目标\n本书作者认为，你越想稳定有规律的通过策略产生盈利，你越应该尽可能地提高交易频率（这里价值投资者们可能要掀桌子了）。这里作者提到了夏普率，并且认为从数学角度，在有能力获得足够高杠杠的前提下，最大的长期盈利的充分条件是发现有最高夏普率的策略。\n(TODO: tax considerations and the limitation on your margin borrowing - chapter 6+)\n\n\n第三部分其实就是讲选择策略的两个指标：夏普率和最大回撤。\n\n夏普率 Sharp Ratio\n\\[ Information Ratio = \\frac{Average of Excess Returns}{Standard Deviation of Excess Returns} \\] \nwhere\n\\[ Excess Returns = Portfolio Returns − Benchmark Returns \\]\n夏普率其实是以上公式当 Benchmark Returns 为无风险利率时的情况，也就是策略必须是货币中立的 / 风险有对冲的（我也不知道怎么翻译 ╮(╯▽╰)╭ ）。\n具体定义和理解不做太多累赘的复述，请自行度娘。backtrader 已经实现了该类，可以直接拿来用或者借鉴理解（这里）。\n注意，\n\n如果一个策略一年只交易不多几次，那么它的夏普率不会太高，但是并不是说这个策略不能盈利。\n如果一个策略有很长时间或者很大程度的回撤（backtrader 也已经实现 这里），那么它的夏普率也不太可能太高。\n如果夏普率小于1，那你基本上可以放弃该策略。如果你想要每个月都有盈利，那么该策略的夏普率应该至少为2。如果一个策略能够做到每天都盈利，那么它的夏普率应该至少为3。\n\n\n最大回撤\n这里有两个概念，最大回撤时间和最大回撤程度。  \n\n\n\n这一章节的重点内容就在这里，我们下节再见惹。

Business》（三）(上)\n\n\nAuthor: Damon Yuan\nDate: 2020-09-29\n微信公众号：手动拆解《How to Build Your Own Algorithmic Trading Business》（三）(上)\n\n\n\n第三章的基本结构如上。\n这部分内容较多，分为上下两个部分。该部分为上。\n第一部分 COMMON BACKTESTING PLATFORMS\n主要讲回测工具与平台，\n\nExcel 基本的吧，\nMatlab 及其变种，\nTradeStation，贵，\n其他高大上平台，更贵，\n\n不能说作者用的工具都过时了，因为我不了解所以可能行业内还是很多人用 Excel 做回测吧？这里我主要用 backtrader 进行回测实现，所以这些平台有兴趣的人自己研究吧。\n第二部分 FINDING AND USING HISTORICAL DATABASES\n主要讲数据源。\n首先关于数据质量有几个重点关注对象，\n\n数据是否复权，前复权还是后复权\n策略是否使用最高或者最低价格\n数据是否存在幸存者偏差\n\n这里我们会用三个免费数据源：Tushare, 富途牛牛 和 Quandl。这几个免费的数据是有幸存者偏差的，也就是说它返回的数值只包含没有退市的股票，需要手动获取停牌股票信息并处理数据。另外一个简单的处理方案是尽量使用最近的数据进行回测这样回测结果比较不会失真。或者花钱买更好的数据。。。穷，不在讨论范围（万德 和 Bloomberg）。\nTushare\n主要用于获取国内各种数据。\n注意日线行情是未复权行情。所以请使用通用行情接口。该接口包含了股票未复权，前复权和后复权数据。\n最后， TuShare 数据包含了最高或者最低价格。\n总而言之，Tushare 数据的调用比较简单，但是从 GitHub 上的 issues 数量上来看，数据质量并不是那么好。\n在 backtrader 中， 我们可以将其包装在一个类中，直接返回 backtrader 可用的数据。\nclass TushareDataFrame:\n    def __init__(self, code, start, end):\n        self.code = code\n        self.start = start\n        self.end = end\n\n    def get_data(self):\n        df = ts.pro_bar(ts_code=self.code, \n                        adj='qfq', \n                        start_date=self.start, \n                        end_date=self.end)\n        df['date'] = df['trade_date']\n        df['volume'] = df['vol']\n        df.index = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])\n        df['openinterest'] = 0\n        df = df[['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume', 'openinterest']]\n        return bt.feeds.PandasData(dataname=df.sort_index(),\n                                                 fromdate=pd.to_datetime(self.start),\n                                                 todate=pd.to_datetime(self.end))\n\n# 在 backtrader 主函数中调用\ndata = TushareDataFrame(code='600000.SH', \n                       start='20100331', \n                       end='20200331').get_data()\ncerebro.adddata(data)\n数据的第一个和第二个问题都得到了解决，而针对幸存者偏差，除了上面提到的尽量使用最近的数据进行回测之外，我们还可以手动查询策略中所用到的时间范围内的退市的股票信息，\nimport tushare as ts\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef get_delisted_stocks(self):\n    pro = ts.pro_api()\n    stocks = pro.stock_basic(exchange='', list_status='D', fields='ts_code,symbol,name,list_date,delist_date')\n    df = stocks[(stocks['list_date']  self.start)]\n    print(df)\n这里我们得到我们回测时间范围内的所有退市股票，在策略中我们可以按需根据这些信息构建完整的历史数据。\n富途牛牛\n这是一家券商做的开放式接口，数据质量应该是比较有保证的。该接口不仅含有低频数据接口，同时还有高频数据接口，跟可直接连接交易系统下单。但是注意富途 API 有每月获取股票信息数量额度限制（每月只可以查询300支股票的信息），需要有其他替代接口。\nimport futu as ft\nimport pandas as pd\nimport backtrader as bt\n\n\nclass FutuDatafeed():\n    def __init__(self, code, start, end):\n

datetime(2018,1,1),\n    buffered= True,\n    apikey=\"XXXXXXXX\"\n    )\n\n# Add the Data Feed to Cerebro\ncerebro.adddata(data)\n该平台对其股价计算作出明确的定义，这里为歪果仁治学严谨点个赞。\n默认 adjclose=True 同时价格数据是前复权。\n但是有的时候我们希望加入数据前对数据提前进行处理，这时候要是能把 datafeed 转化成 pandas dataframe就好了，可惜我没有发现这个方法。此时我们可以用另一种方法获取 quandl 数据。\nquandl.ApiConfig.api_key = QUANDL_API_KEY\n...\n    def get_data(self):\n        df = quandl.get('WIKI/AAPL')\n        df = df.rename(index={'Date': 'date'},\n                       columns={'Open': 'open',\n                              'Close': 'close',\n                              'High': 'high',\n                              'Low': 'low',\n                              'Volume': 'volume'})\n        df['openinterest'] = 0\n        df = df[['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume', 'openinterest']]\n        return bt.feeds.PandasData(dataname=df.sort_index(),\n                                   fromdate=self.start,\n                                   todate=self.end)\nYahoo\n差点忘记这个数据大佬，python 有一个叫 pandas-datareader 的包，用以下代码可直接返回backtrader可用的数据，\nfrom pandas_datareader import data\nimport backtrader as bt\n\n\nclass YahooDatafeed():\n    def __init__(self, code, start, end):\n        self.code = code\n        self.start = start # '2018-01-01'\n        self.end = end # '2019-01-01'\n\n    def get_data(self):\n        df = data.DataReader(self.code,\n                               start=self.start,\n                               end=self.start,\n                               data_source='yahoo')\n        df = df.rename(index={'Date': 'date'},\n                       columns={'Open': 'open',\n                                'Adj Close': 'close',\n                                'High': 'high',\n                                'Low': 'low',\n                                'Volume': 'volume'})\n        df['openinterest'] = 0\n        print(df.head())\n        return bt.feeds.PandasData(dataname=df.sort_index(),\n                                   fromdate=self.start,\n                                   todate=self.end)\n第三部分 PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT\n回测结果分析指标。上一章介绍了两个最终要的指标：夏普率和最大回撤（时间和幅度）。鉴于 backtrader 已经实现了这两个参数，这里就不在累赘，直接拿来用即可。有兴趣的话可以参考源代码。\n这部分作者有提到一个是否需要在 strategy return 中减去 risk-free rate 来作为计算 Sharpe Ratio 的 excess return 的细节问题。作者认为 dollar-neutral portfolio, 比如 long-short strategy，和日内交易都不需要，因为这些种类的交易都没有带来融资成本。\n同时在计算 long-short strategy return 时候，要注意除以2，因为这时候你有双倍的资金（注意 backtrader Sharpe Ratio 计算 代码中并看不出来有没有除以2，如有需要请自行验证）。\n第四部分 COMMON BACKTESTING PITFALLS TO AVOID\n这部分主要介绍了回测容易发生的几大问题。\nLook-ahead bias\n解决方法是只用前一个休市之前的数据来计算当前策略因子（当然如果你只在休市时候交易，那也可以用当天的数据）。\n统计上的验证方法是，删去最近 N 天的数据来计算 position file B, 并与现在的 position file A 做比较，如果 T - N 天前的仓位数据是完全一样的，那说明没有 look-ahead bias, 否则你很有可能用了 T - N 天 内的数据来影响 position file A 中 T - N 天前的仓位数据。\n过分耦合 Data-snooping bias\n诀窍是不在策略中引进过多的参数（作者说他自己不会引进多余 5 个的参数）。其他一些手段包括\n保证样本数量足够大\n对 tick 单位为每日的交易来说 n = 252 x number of free parameters；对 tick 单位为每分钟的交易来说 n = （252 / trading hours per day / 60）x number of free parameters\n样品外测试\n其实交易策略的过程和机器学习十分相似，都可以分为，\n\n收集数据\n数据清洗\n数据分析\n训练模型\n测试\n使用\n\n其中 1 和 2 数据源和量化工具已经帮我们做好了，第 3 步就是交易策略，第 4 步属于根据现有真实数据调节参数以达到收益目标，第 5 步也需要根据现有真实数据来验证策略是不是有效，验证成功后第 6 步才是应用于真实的交易环境中。\n这里我们可以看到 4 和 5 都用到了真实数据，那么怎么可以保证训练用数据和测试用数据能够相互独立不会因为过拟合导致测试失效呢？作者提出的简单的方法是把数据分成两份，然后一份用作训练，一份用作测试。Paper trading 就是一种既可以完成真正的样本外测试，又可以让你发现各式各样运行问题的一种交易方法，这个方法会在第五章进行详细阐述。\n同时如果你在测试一个从公开刊物发表的策略，从文章发表时间到现在这段时间的数据绝对是样本外数据，是可以放心使用的。\n另外一个方法是使用 parameterless trading framework, 来在移动持仓窗口（moving lookback window）中动态的优化参数。这个时候利润帽（profit cap）也会由模型本身决定而不会是一个输入的参数。这块作者在本书中没有详细阐述，有兴趣的人可以查找相关资料学习。\n"},"series/quantitative-trading-with-backtrader/2020-09-29-qt-htbyoatb-3.2/2020-09-29-qt-htbyoatb-3.2.html":{"url":"series/quantitative-trading-with-backtrader/2020-09-29-qt-htbyoatb-3.2/2020-09-29-qt-htbyoatb-3.2.html","title":"Chapter

ratio），然后为这个配对交易策略设置进入和退出门槛。\n首先是获取数据和数据清洗。\n这里补充以下 Yahoo 金融数据的获取，因为上一章介绍的其他三个方法都无法获得 GLD 和 GDX 的金融数据（尤其是 FUTU API, 会返回 NN_ProtoRet_TimeOut，不专业啊少年）。\nfrom pandas_datareader import data\nimport

self.gdx = self.gdx.sort_index()\n        self.gdx['openinterest'] = 0\n        print(self.gdx.head())\n\n        s = self.gld.index.size // 2\n        self.gld_train = self.gld[:s]\n        self.gld_test = self.gld[s:]\n        self.gdx_train = self.gdx[:s]\n        self.gdx_test = self.gdx[s:]\n上面代码我已经添加注释说明我们具体需要做些什么。\n分析\n这里我们需要理解一些概念，\n\n线性回归（linear regression）\nOrdinary Least Squares（OLS）\n损耗方程（cost function），最小二乘法（least square method）\n梯度下降（gradient descent）\n对冲指数（hedge-ratio）\nz-score, 用于量化一个数据同其样本平均值中的差距\n\n因为不是数学或者金融课，这里就不一一讲解了。\n总结一下这个 pair trading 例子是用线性回归的办法，利用 OLS 模型，使用最小二乘法这个数学优化建模方法建立损耗方程，通过梯度下降的办法求其最优参数，而且取参数中的斜率作为对冲指数（hedge-ratio）。通过这个对冲指数计算这对股票的差价（spread），如果高出一定差价则做空头操作，如果低于一定差价则做多头操作，若处于中间则做退出操作。\n关于配对交易（pair trading）backtrader 有一片博文来解释同时也有一个详细的例子，但是和这本书里面的方法有些许不同。这本书中的方法用训练集算出的对冲指数是一个静态值，再用测试集验证其有效性。而 backtrader 中的例子通用计算移动平均线的方法来计算线性回归中的斜率使其动态化，我想这可能就是上一章所说的 parameterless trading framework。个人理解好处是能够使对冲指数反应指数变化从而自动作出调整，缺点是有可能过拟合。有兴趣的人可以查阅以下资料，\n\nbacktrader pair trading example\nbacktrader pair trading blog\n\n我用 Python 实现了一下书中的 Matlab 代码，如下\n    def analyze(self):\n        train_feature = self.gdx_train['close'] # 获取特征值\n        train_target = self.gld_train['close'] # 获取目标值\n        train_feature = sm.add_constant(train_feature, prepend=False) # 注意如不加这句线性回归中的常量会被设置为0\n        train_model = sm.OLS(train_target, train_feature).fit() # 利用训练集进行 OLS 线性回归\n        train_predictions = train_model.predict(train_feature) # 获得预测值 \n        train_hedge_ratio = train_model.params['close'] # 获得斜率也就是对冲指数\n        train_spread = train_target - train_hedge_ratio*train_feature['close'] # 豁目标值与特征值对冲后的差价\n        train_spread_mean = train_spread.mean() # 获取差价的平均数用于计算 z-score\n        train_spread_std = train_spread.std() # 获取差价的标准差用于计算 z-score\n\n        class GoldStrategy(bt.Strategy):\n            # 这里我们设定如果 z-score =2, 做空\n            # 如果 |z-score| = self.p.shorts: # 查看有没有到空头阈值\n                    self.log(\n                        'sell the spread - gld close %.2f and gdx close %.2f' % (self.gldclose[0], self.gdxclose[0]))\n                    sell_size = int(self.params.portfolio_value * 0.5 / self.gldclose[0]) # 计算卖出目标值 GLD 数量，注意资金量需要乘以0.5\n                    buy_size = int(self.params.portfolio_value * 0.5 / self.gdxclose[0]) # 计算买入特征值 GDX 数量，注意资金量需要乘以0.5\n                    self.sell_order = self.sell(data=self.datas[0], size=sell_size) # 先卖出 GLD\n                    self.buy_order = self.buy(data=self.datas[1], size=buy_size) # 再买入 GDX\n                else:\n                    return\n\n            def stop(self):\n                self.log('Ending Value %.2f' % self.broker.getvalue())\n\n        return GoldStrategy # 返回策略\n注意，一个潜在的用 backtrader 做回测的好处是你不需要把所有数据滞后一个 tick 时间，因为 backtrader 下单执行交易总是在下一个 tick（在书中作者用了一个 lag 函数来达到同样的目的）。\n对上面的线性回归结果画图，\nplt.scatter(train_feature['close'], train_target, color='black', s=1)\nplt.plot(train_feature['close'], train_predictions, color='blue', linewidth=3)\nplt.xticks(())\nplt.yticks(())\nplt.xlabel('GDX')\nplt.ylabel('GLD')\nplt.show()\n结果如下，\n\n这条线的应用意义就在于我们可以通过其预测符合线性回归的两只股票相对值的数值，如果实际上两只股票相对值偏差预测值太大，我们就认为存在套利空间，因为数学上我们认为迟早这个数值是会回归到预测值上的。\n对对冲后的差价画图，\ntest = (train_spread - train_spread_mean) / train_spread_std\ntest.plot()\nplt.show()\n\n这种价差围绕着 0 上下往复的均值回复属性是我们的配对交易策略的基础，均值回复的幅度越大，频率越频繁，对我们的套利空间越有利。\n训练集回测\n得到可用策略之后我们就可以把训练集代入 backtrader 中进行回测。用训练集进行回测的意义在于调节参数，我们再认为策略有理论基础的情况下，调节参数使其结果指数参数达到最优。\n    def train(self):\n        cerebro = bt.Cerebro() # 初始化引擎\n        cerebro.adddata(bt.feeds.PandasData(dataname=self.gld_train.sort_index(),\n                                   fromdate=pd.to_datetime(self.start),\n                                   todate=pd.to_datetime(self.end)), name='gld') # 加入 GLD 数据\n        cerebro.adddata(bt.feeds.PandasData(dataname=self.gdx_train.sort_index(),\n

方法返回的是刚刚定义的策略类\n        cerebro.addanalyzer(bt.analyzers.SharpeRatio, _name='SharpeRatio', riskfreerate=0.0) # 加入夏普比率分析指数\n        cerebro.addanalyzer(bt.analyzers.DrawDown, _name='DW') # 加入回撤指标\n        cerebro.broker.setcash(100) # 设置起始资金，注意我们的策略是货币中性策略，理论上不需要起始资金\n        cerebro.broker.setcommission(commission=0) # 设置佣金为0\n        results = cerebro.run(maxcpus=1) # 没有速度要求的情况下单核当线程运行避免一些不必要的线程问题\n        strat = results[0] # 获取回测结果\n        print('夏普比率:', strat.analyzers.SharpeRatio.get_analysis())\n        print('回撤指标:', strat.analyzers.DW.get_analysis())\n通过回测我们可以发现以下指标，\nHedge-Ratio: 1.9790671781349194\n2006-09-05, buy the spread - gld close 63.36 and gdx close 38.49\n2006-09-11, close the spread - gld close 58.50 and gdx close 33.28\n2007-08-15, sell the spread - gld close 66.13 and gdx close 33.42\n2007-09-06, close the spread - gld close 68.86 and gdx close 37.55\n2007-10-31, buy the spread - gld close 78.62

AutoOrderedDict([('len', 248), ('drawdown', 138.48176286704742), ('moneydown', 10304908752441)]))])\n与书中数据作对比差距还是比较大的，最后结果居然是亏的，暂时我没有发现为什么会有这个差距（可能是夏普比率计算方法，可能输数据所取的时间段和书中不同），我会在后续解读中慢慢分析，先不纠结这个了。\nbacktrader 还提供了画图功能,\nplt.rcParams['font.sans-serif'] = ['SimHei']\nplt.rcParams['axes.unicode_minus'] = False\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [9, 8]\nplt.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 125\nplt.rcParams['figure.facecolor'] = 'w'\nplt.rcParams['figure.edgecolor'] = 'k'\ncerebro.plot(iplot=False)\n\n测试集验证\n假定我们对训练参数所表现的结果是满意的，下一步就是用测试集数据验证这个策略是否真的有效还是只是数据的过拟合。这里我们需要做的只是把训练数据改成测试数据,\ncerebro.adddata(bt.feeds.PandasData(dataname=self.gld_test.sort_index(),\n                                   fromdate=pd.to_datetime(self.start),\n                                   todate=pd.to_datetime(self.end)), name='gld')\ncerebro.adddata(bt.feeds.PandasData(dataname=self.gdx_test.sort_index(),\n                                   fromdate=pd.to_datetime(self.start),\n                                   todate=pd.to_datetime(self.end)), name='gdx')\n之后我们得到结果，\nHedge-Ratio: 1.9790671781349194\n2008-03-10, sell the spread - gld close 95.87 and gdx close 47.94\n2008-03-13, close the spread - gld close 98.34 and gdx close 52.26\n2008-03-19, sell the spread - gld close 93.04 and gdx close 46.03\n2009-12-21, Ending Value -838.18\n夏普比率: OrderedDict([('sharperatio', -0.5109222191683993)])\n回撤指标: AutoOrderedDict([('len', 278), ('drawdown', 174.82611759058264), ('moneydown', 1958.349838256836), ('max', AutoOrderedDict([('len', 278), ('drawdown', 232.69145403451998), ('moneydown', 2606.5400161743164)]))])\nHedge-ratio 不变，因为我们还是用训练集得到的参数，然后我们发现夏普比例，回报都比训练集中的结果差，这个时候我们就需要反思策略思路和策略实现的正确性。\n\n最后作者还验证了我们的策略没有包含未来函数。他的做法和上一篇文章提到的一样，去掉测试集中最近的60天的数据，再对新的测试集进行回测，然后对比之前测试集的回测仓位。如果没有未来函数，在60天前这两次回测的仓位应该是完全一样的。鉴于文章篇幅，我这里就不再实现了。\n敏感性分析（Sensitivity Analysis）\n这个分析主要目的是避免策略数据过拟合。如果改变参数对回测结果影响巨大，那么说明我们的策略很有可能对数据进行了过拟合，那这个策略是不可用的。\n原则上我们应该尽可能在不影响测试回测结果的条件下，减少策略中的条件，限制和参数，即使这有可能导致训练回测的结果变差。\n第五部分 TRANSACTION COSTS\n交易费用由很多种，\n\n佣金（commission）\n流动成本（liquidity cost）\n机会成本（opportunity cost）\n市场影响（market impact）\n滑点成本 (slippage)\n\n这部分作者用了一个均值反转模型来证明交易费用对策略有效性的影响，处于篇幅考虑这里就不再用 backtrader 复现了，但是这里推荐一篇类似文章 - Backtesting a Cross-Sectional Mean Reversion Strategy in Python，有兴趣的读者可以查阅。\n总而言之作者想传达一个信号，在考虑交易费用的情况下很多看似可行的交易策略都会无效。\n第六部分 STRATEGY REFINEMENT\n这一部分简要讲述了一些策略优化的方法。优化策略在不适当的情况下可能会引入数据过耦合，优化的原则和参数优化原则相似，都是必须保证优化后，测试集回测能达到同训练集回测类似的获利表现提升。\n一些简单的策略可能看似再也无法获利了，毕竟太多人在利用它获利，事实上加入一些简单的改动就有可能让它重新发挥作用，比如\n\n有的交易员会把医药股从他的量化组合中剔除因为股价受消息影响太大\n出于同样的原因，有的交易员会把有并购或者收购可能的公司股票剔除\n其他交易者会更改交易进入和退出的时间或频率\n还有一些策略在科创版上可能会有很好的表现，在 A 股市场可能就不太能获利\n\n总结\n这里我觉得有一句话值得再提一下，量化交易是在分析过往数据，期望从中找出规律并利用其获利的一种策略。为什么提这个，因为在日常生活中我们会听到无数的反对声音告诉我们这种策略是无效的，人没有办法遇见未来。我个人意见是在数据量足够大，交易足够迅速的情况下，量化自动化交易无论在效率上还是风控上都从整体高于个人，何况交易策略的主体还是个人 - 如果一个人有足够的能力在不用量化交易的情况下分析各种条件获利，量化只会是他更好的工具去创造更大的获利空间。\n"},"series/quantitative-trading-with-backtrader/2020-10-01-qt-htbyoatb-4/2020-10-01-qt-htbyoatb-4.html":{"url":"series/quantitative-trading-with-backtrader/2020-10-01-qt-htbyoatb-4/2020-10-01-qt-htbyoatb-4.html","title":"Chapter

Business》（四）\n\n\n第三章花了好多时间讲了回测这个重要的概念，脑细胞死掉了不少，更可怕的是头发也掉了很多。这个梗虽然都被玩烂了，但是我还是想玩一下。\n\n感谢作者第四章给了我们休息的机会，不是那么硬核了（别杠，杠就你对）。\n这章跳出了技术角度，从业务角度来分析了几个开展交易业务前的重要步骤：开哪种账户，需要哪些功能，还有接入哪个实体系统进行交易。\n\n首先是开个人账户还是加入一家专门的交易公司账户。这是我们需要考虑的问题吗？\n\n作者这里遇到的情况和中国甚至香港市场都有很大不同，虽然不同的市场对个人投资者都有各式各样的限制，但是大体上这些限制或者说信息的不对称都是在慢慢宽松或者减少。对于作者说的加入一家 Trading Company，大家看看就好了，99% 的人都没有他的学历，工作经验来支撑他随便跳到一家交易公司的，呵呵🙃。\n下一个问题。\n什么？还是问你用个人交易账户还是加入一家公司用公司账户？我们当然知道公司账户佣金低，但是这个差距也在逐渐减少，像下面这种交易费率已经是相当普及的了，\n\n除非是超高频策略，我想不出什么理由在佣金角度个人投资者会有多大劣势。\n但是需要注意的是机构相对于个人有许多特别的功能。比如这里提到了一个 \"Dark-pool liquidity\" 的概念，我的理解是各种机构内部组成的一个交易系统，相当于地下钱庄，所以这里的交易订单是不会在股市上出现的。我不知道现在是不是还有这个功能，或者是不是香港大陆机构也有这个功能，但是大机构肯定有小散看不到的优势。\n不过，这些和大多数韭菜，似乎也没有什么关系。这部分我们就不再纠结了，留给韭菜的选择不多🙅‍。\n第三部分。。。告诉你要有好的电脑，好的网络，等等。。。重要但是挺无聊的。\n就酱。\n"},"series/quantitative-trading-with-backtrader/2020-10-01-qt-htbyoatb-5/2020-10-01-qt-htbyoatb-5.html":{"url":"series/quantitative-trading-with-backtrader/2020-10-01-qt-htbyoatb-5/2020-10-01-qt-htbyoatb-5.html","title":"Chapter

API，我们这里将使用富途牛牛。富途牛牛提供了两个账号：一个真实账号，另外一个是虚拟账号。这里我们可以先用虚拟账号接入，在确认一切测试完美之后才进行真实账号交易。\n第二部分介绍如何降低交易费率。如上一篇所说，现在的交易费用已经降低了非常多，如果不是高频交易，交易费用对获利的影响不大。作者另外提到一个订单大小问题，他认为每一个订单不应该超过每日交易量的百分之一。\n\n。。。我觉得对于大部分的证券市场我都没有问题。。。当然如果你交易市场流动性不佳，那还是要小心点的。\n第三部分说用 Paper Trading 来验证策略。例如富途牛牛有虚拟账号，我们可以直接接入然后测试。\n第四部分讲如何在期望和实际利润偏差过大的时候找到原因。这里罗列了一些可能的原因，而实际上可能的原因比这些多了太多所以我不一一列举额的，具体情况具体分析。\n因为一章的内容和当今的科技发展相比落后了太多，接下来我们来看如何在 backtrader 中接入富途牛牛。\n首先我们来看一种简单的办法, 一般我们会在 backtrader Strategy next() 判断是否需要生成订单。我们可以每天在收市后，收集最新的数据，运行回测。如果有生成订单，我们就可以调用富途牛牛 API 提前生成相应的订单，在第二天会自动执行。在之后的回测中，把订单结果录入到 backtrader 中。\n步骤为，\n\n1）每天在收市后，收集最新的数据，运行回测\n2）检查 backtrader Strategy next() 判断是否需要生成订单\n3）如果有生成订单，我们就可以调用富途牛牛 API 提前生成相应的订单，在第二天会自动执行。\n4）在之后的回测加入现有订单。\n\n另外一种复杂的方法是利用 backtrader Live Trading 的概念集成 FUTU API。backtrader Live Trading 集成主要由 3 个 class 组成：broker, data 和 store。最近进度有点慢，主要就是在理解 backtrader 源代码，之后会开源此部分(meta programming in Python 有点蛋疼）。\n"},"series/quantitative-trading-with-backtrader/2020-10-20-qt-htbyoatb-6.1/2020-10-20-qt-htbyoatb-6.1.html":{"url":"series/quantitative-trading-with-backtrader/2020-10-20-qt-htbyoatb-6.1/2020-10-20-qt-htbyoatb-6.1.html","title":"Chapter

Business》（六.1）\n来到第六章，照例放上思维导图吧。\n\n这一章的第一部分讲的的是如何对资金进行分配和使用杠杠。我们知道如果对于一个策略我们有 100% 信心盈利，那么我们应该尽可能地提高杠杠来获取最大利益，这当然是在理想状态下的假设，现实中往往在收益越大的情况下，风险也会放大，在加大杠杠的情况下一次回撤就有可能让投资者清仓离场。那么我们如何在同时运行一个或者几个策略的情况下，对资金进行合理的分配和采用杠杠率来使得长远获利最大化呢？这里我们将运用到凯利公式。\n我们投资的目的是最大化长期回报，这意味着归零或者更甚的损失是必须避免的, 这里我们简单介绍一下凯利公式的推导。\n假设一次投资获利的概率为 P, 每次获利的 b 元（赔率为 1:b）。那么多次重复最优投资比例 f 应该是\n  f=P−(1−P)b \n  f = P - {(1 - P)\\over b}\n  f=P−​b​​(1−P)​​\n那么它的推导过程是什么呢？假设我们有本金 \\( A_0 \\)，那么在 k 次投资之后取决于赢钱还是输钱，你的本金会变为 \\( A_k+1 = A_k \\times (1 + bf) \\) 或者 \\( A_k+1 = A_k \\times (1 - f) \\)。假设我们总共投资了 N 次，那么这时我们的资金会是\n  AN=A0(1+bf)NP(1−f)N(1−P) A_N = A_0(1 + bf)^NP(1 - f)^{N(1 - P)} A​N​​=A​0​​(1+bf)​N​​P(1−f)​N(1−P)​​\n所以\n  ANA0N=(1+bf)P(1−f)1−P \\sqrt[N]{A_N \\over A_0} = (1 + bf)^P(1 - f)^{1 - P} ​N​​√​​A​0​​​​A​N​​​​​​​=(1+bf)​P​​(1−f)​1−P​​  \n即为一次投资的平均回报率。我们要求这个数为最大。对两边取对数，\n  lnF(f)=Pln(1+bf)+(1−P)ln(1−f) lnF(f) = Pln(1 + bf) + (1 - P)ln(1 - f)lnF(f)=Pln(1+bf)+(1−P)ln(1−f)  \n对数函数是一个增函数，那么想要让等式的左边最大，那么我们就需要对 f 求导,\n  dlnF(f)df=Pb1+bf−1−P1−f=0 {d_{lnF(f)} \\over d_{f}}  = {Pb \\over 1 + bf} - {1 - P \\over 1 - f} = 0 ​d​f​​​​d​lnF(f)​​​​=​1+bf​​Pb​​−​1−f​​1−P​​=0  \n这样的话我们会得到上面提到的最优投资比例。\n但是聪明的你肯定已经发现一个问题，这里投资的获利概率 P 是固定的，但是股票投资获利的概率不是固定的，同时每次获利的数值也不是固定的，那么在这种情况下怎么计算每次投资的最优比例 f 呢？请听下回分解。\n"},"series/quantitative-trading-with-backtrader/2020-10-20-qt-htbyoatb-6.2/2020-10-20-qt-htbyoatb-6.2.html":{"url":"series/quantitative-trading-with-backtrader/2020-10-20-qt-htbyoatb-6.2/2020-10-20-qt-htbyoatb-6.2.html","title":"Chapter
