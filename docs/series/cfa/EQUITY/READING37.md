# Reading 37 - Security Market Indexes

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

### a. describe a security market index;

A security market index represents a given security market, market segment, or asset class. Most indexes are constructed as portfolios of marketable securities.

### b. calculate and interpret the value, price return, and total return of an index;
- the value of a price return index
    - single-period returns
- the value of a total return index
### c. describe the choices and issues in index construction and management;
Decisions,
- Target Market and Security Selection
- Index Weighting
    - Price Weighting
        - The value of the price-weighted index is determined by dividing the sum of the security values (101.50) by the divisor
    - Equal Weighting
        - the weights in an equal-weighted index are arbitrarily assigned by the index provider
        - maintaining equal weights requires frequent adjustments (rebalancing) to the index.
    - Market-Capitalization Weighting
        - Market capitalization or value is calculated by multiplying the number of shares out- standing by the market price per share.
        - subtypes
            - Float-Adjusted Market-Capitalization Weighting
                - market float is the number of shares of the constituent security that are available to the investing public.
                - further reduce the number of shares included in the index by excluding shares that are not available to foreigner investors. (free-float-adjusted market-capitalization- weighted indexes)
    - Fundamental Weighting
### d. compare the different weighting methods used in index construction;
- Rebalancing refers to adjusting the weights of the constituent securities in the index.
- Reconstitution is the process of changing the constituent securities in an index.
### e. calculate and analyze the value and return of an index given its weighting method;
### f. describe rebalancing and reconstitution of an index;
### g. describe uses of security market indexes;
- gauges of market sentiment;
- proxies for measuring and modeling returns, systematic risk, and risk-adjusted performance;
    - capital asset pricing model ([CAPM](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp))
        - ERi = Rf + beta * (ERm - Rf)
        - two assumptions:
            - (1) securities markets are very competitive and efficient (that is, relevant information about the companies is quickly and universally distributed and absorbed);
            - (2) these markets are dominated by rational, risk-averse investors, who seek to maximize satisfaction from returns on their investments.
- proxies for asset classes in asset allocation models;
- benchmarks for actively managed portfolios; and
- model portfolios for such investment products as index funds and exchange- traded funds (ETFs).
### h. describe types of equity indexes;
- Broad Market Indexes
- Multi-market indexes
    - MSCI
        - level of economic development
            - developed markets
            - emerging markets
            - frontier markets
        - geographic region
            - longitudinal lines of the globe
                - the Americas
                - Europe with Africa
                - and Asia with the Pacific
        - country- and region-specific indexes
    - Fundamental Weighting in Multi-Market Indexes
- Sector Indexes
- Style Indexes
    - Market Capitalization (absolute market capitalization / relative market capitalization)
        - large cap
        - midcap
        - and small cap
    - Value/Growth Classification
    - Market Capitalization and Value/Growth Classification

### i. describe types of fixed-income indexes;
- fixed-income universe
    - governments
    - government agencies
    - corporations
- fixed-income index categories
    - aggregate or broad market indexes
    - market sector indexes
    - style indexes
    - economic sector indexes
    - specialized indexes such as high-yield, inflation-linked, and emerging market indexes
### j. describe indexes representing alternative investments;
- alternative investments
    - commodities
    - real estate
        - appraisal index
        - repeat sales index
        - real estate investment trust index
    - hedge funds
### k. compare types of security market indexes.

## PRACTICE PROBLEMS

    - Market Segment
        - Homogeneity
        - Distinction
        - Reaction
    - An asset class is a grouping of investments that exhibit similar characteristics and are subject to the same laws and regulations. Asset classes are made up of instruments which often behave similarly to one another in the marketplace.

    it comes down to the fundamental question of what is “the market portfolio” in the Capital Asset Pricing Model ?

    In theory, it should represent ‘ALL investable assets’.

    However, in practice there is no single market index that can perfectly represents all investable assets. So hence the the term “Proxy of Systematic Risk” rather than “Measures of Systematic Risk”.

24. B
25. !A -> C, Style indexes represent groups of securities classified according to market capitalization, value, growth, or a combination of these characteristics.

33. !A, Voluntary performance reporting may lead to survivorship bias, and poorer performing hedge funds will be less likely to report their performance.
