# Reading 38 - Market Efficiency

## Learning Outcomes

- models
  - DCF (Discounted Cash flow)
  - dividend discount model: used for predicting the price of a company's stock based on the theory that its present-day price is worth the sum of all of its future dividend payments when discounted back to their present value.
