## Comparing Payments Systems

Payments systems users consider it when evaluating new payments forms.

- Open or closed loop? 
- “Push” or “pull” payments? 
- [Net](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/net-settlement/) or gross settlement? 
- Ownership—private vs. public; 
- bank owned or not? 
- Regulation—private rules and/or law/regulations? 
- Batch or real-time processing?
- Economic model—at par?; is there interchange between participants? 
- Which brand is used (and how)? 
- Does the payment system define “products”? 
- Do payment system rules determine: 
  - If payment is guaranteed or not? 
  - Timing of funding—before, at the time of, or after the transaction? 
- How are exceptions handled? 
- Fraud management procedures? 
- Dispute handling—is it handled as part of the payment system?

- “Ad valorem” fees are better than flat fees 
- Cross-currency is lucrative 
- Processing demands scale to be viable 
- Businesses pay to be paid 
- Banked consumers don’t pay to pay; unbanked consumers generally do 
- Exception processing is expensive 
- Simplicity has economic value

- Visa, Mastercard, American Express and PayPal are all examples of what we Visa, Mastercard, American Express and PayPal are all examples of what we call thick model network
- houses, the ACH, and PIN debit networks are all examples of this “thin model.”

## Cross-border Payments

As background, remember that payments systems, by definition, operate on an in-country basis: only banks that are chartered or licensed to operate in a country may join a payments system in that country. Because of this, transferring money between countries often requires two separate transactions, one in the sending country and one in the receiving country. This is true even if the transaction is denominated in the same currency in both systems.

[example of transaction with Exchange](https://github.com/omgnetwork/ewallet/blob/master/docs/design/transactions_and_entries.md)

examples:

- In reality, however, the global card network is keeping the complexity of the cross-border system “under the hood.”
- ACH-to-ACH service, Federal Reserve's Global ACH service
- SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area)

correspondent bank accounts -> 往来账户
- The global financial services messaging service [SWIFT](https://www.swift.com/) plays an important role in carrying instructions about these payments from one bank to another.
